# CATS Setup Guide

# Introduction

Welcome to the CATS (Combinatorial Auction Test Suite) Setup Guide. This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up and utilize CATS, a powerful tool designed for generating combinatorial auction instances. These instances are specifically crafted for testing and evaluating combinatorial auction algorithms.

CATS offers a diverse range of distributions, including realistic, economically motivated domains and artificial distributions commonly referenced in academic literature.

For detailed information about CATS and its capabilities, visit [CATS website](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~kevinlb/CATS/).

Follow the setup instructions corresponding to your operating system for a seamless experience.
This program is primarily designed for Linux, offering a more beginner-friendly environment.
Whenever feasible, it's recommended to run CATS on Linux for optimal compatibility.
Please note that the Windows tutorial has been written and tested on Windows 11.
For Windows 10, the steps may vary slightly but should be very similar.

This tutorial guides you through the source code compilation, which may require some time during setup. 
However, once compiled, generating and executing Combinatorial Auctions becomes a swift and straightforward process.
